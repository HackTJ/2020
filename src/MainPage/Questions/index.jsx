                  answer=<span>
                    In the context of a hackathon, &quot;hacking&quot; is to
                    build a real application over the length of the event.
                    It&apos;s important to not confuse this with illegal
                    hacking, which is gaining unauthorized access to a computer.

                    If you already have a team of 2-4 people you want to work
                    with, that&apos;s awesome! If not don&apos;t worry because
                    we&apos;ll have an opportunity for people to join a team if
                    they need one.

                  question="Can I be a mentor, judge, or volunteer?"
                  small={true}
                  answer=<span>
                    Mentors work interactively with students to help them
                    develop their projects. This could mean brainstorming ideas,
                    teaching students new skills or languages, and
                    troubleshooting when they run into obstacles. If you have
                    any experience with CS and are available at any time during
                    HackTJ, you can be a mentor! Judges listen to student
                    pitches during our Sunday-morning expo and decide which
                    projects are winners. Experience is preferred but not
                    necessary. Volunteers help our team with logistical tasks
                    such as registration, food service, and chaperoning. No
                    experience is necessary to be a volunteer. Registration for
                    these roles will open in March, but you can reach out to{" "}
