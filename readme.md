# HackTJ 2020

The website for HackTJ 2020, held on March 21st-22nd, 2020.

## Setup

-   `npm install`
-   `npm start`

## Development

We use ReactJS.

## Notes for next year

For next year's hackathon, you need to fork this repo and rename the copy to [current year + 1] - that way it will be displayed on our website at hacktj.org/[current year + 1] while leaving the old website up at hacktj.org/[current year].
